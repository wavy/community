# wavy.fm Community Code of Conduct

[wavy.fm](https://wavy.fm) aims to host an inclusive and diverse community. This document outlines
the responsibilities and expectations of all our users to achieve this goal, together.

## Pledge

We, as wavy.fm users, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We achieve this by creating a positive environment through positive and inclusive behavior according to our standards.

## Standards

 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
 * Focusing on what is best for the community
 * Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 * Public or private harassment
 * Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
 * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in an inclusive community

## Responsibilities

Every member of our community is responsible for adhering to these standards to create a positive environment.

Staff members are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all platforms and communities officially maintained by wavy.fm staff, which include:

 * The wavy.fm [website](https://wavy.fm) and related applications
 * The wavy.fm [Discord server](https://discord.gg/T2nvHdP)
 * The wavy.fm [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/wavyfm)
 * The wavy.fm [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/wavyfm)

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is representing the website or its community in public places.
Representation of the website may be further defined and clarified by staff.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the wavy.fm staff
at **contact@wavy.fm**. In addition, such instances may be reported through the 'Report' functionality of the
various platforms, as well as contacting the staff of third-party websites.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.
